# Happy Path Documentation: Option "Nur ohne Bindung"

## Overview

This document outlines the happy path scenarios for testing the "Nur ohne Bindung" (No Binding) option within the tariff recommendation form. The happy path scenarios are designed to verify that the system behaves as expected when the user interacts with the form correctly.

## Test Case: Happy Path for "Nur ohne Bindung"

### Description
**Objective:** Verify that the system correctly processes the form submission when the user selects the "Nur ohne Bindung" option and provides valid inputs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The "Nur ohne Bindung" checkbox must be selectable and visible.
- The form should accept valid inputs in the required fields.
- The system should display tariffs that are available without any binding upon form submission.

### Expected Results
- The form should be submitted successfully without errors.
- The tariffs displayed should match the "Nur ohne Bindung" filter criteria.

## Test File Location
The test case for this happy path scenario is located in the file `no-binding-option.spec.ts`.

## Notes
- Ensure that all inputs are valid and meet the expected format and constraints.
- This test case assumes the form validation and backend processing are functioning correctly.

## Additional Scenarios
- Further testing may be required for edge cases and invalid inputs, which should be documented separately.
